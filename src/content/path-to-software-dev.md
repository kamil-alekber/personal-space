When I embarked myself on path of a software developer I thought there will be no end to gaining knowledge. I mean with the current type of job I would be studying almost without any break. First you go through HTML, CSS & JS, following with some frontend library like [**React**](https://reactjs.org/), steadily transfer towards a backend development which is most likely a NodeJS since it eradicate the need to learn a new programming language thus making you focus on learning backend concepts rather than daunting yourself with the syntax of an unfamiliar language.

From my yearly childhood, I was always a type of person who likes to study and gain knowledge that I most likely to utilize. By that logic, one can deduce following:

- Natural (derived from observations) sciences that have some sort of proof were the most preferred
- Subjects that have popular opinions and depend on a social political environment tend to be mostly influenced by the status quo and thus are subjects of my disgrace.

But here is the thing, when I finished school I was not sure what to become of me, so due to my lack of experience, knowledge of the operating powers around me I foolishly chose International Relations to be my future endeavor. In turns of grades, I did fine. Most of the subjects did not need to much attention from my sight: read a chapter, write essay or make a presentation on a topic and be done. Pretty much easy. With such a degree, you don't really need to attend university for that. Anyone can open a book about some time in history and politics, read the chapters and express your opinion on matter. That's the whole formula to succeed as a student of IR.

Moving forward to the graduation, I started to contemplate the idea that I'm not particularly looking good at the job market, and to my surprise no hunting agency needed my expertise in the International World Politics thus rendering my skills pretty much useless. Thanks to my character of not being stubborn I was thinking to pursue a new career while my "main" had not even started by that time.

So, logical choice was for the time being analyze the market and look for patterns: low supply & high demand. The current world has become more digitalized and the need for digital aborigens were at its highest. But what should I pick from: game dev, frontend, backend, AI developer, data science and the list goes on... The time constraint and the lack of technical people around me I started to consume one course over the other from game dev to web dev and building my first regression model. [**Unity**](https://unity.com/), [**CodeCademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/), and later [**Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/) were my initial directions towards mastering CS skills. I didn't use YouTube mainly because of two reasons:

- No idea what topics should I study and in what particular order
- Not knowing which channels would assist me the most, since the time pressure was high and the imposter syndrome kept reminding of itself

My father says whatever the job your start no matter how big or small it is you will always push though to complete the task at hand. Circumstances pop up from all the corners imaginable so you will have to prevail and move forward. That was exactly what I did but sometimes I felt some of the decisions I made along the way hindered by progress. For instance, I could have concentrated more on web-development but instead I was juggling with mobile & cross-platform development. Don't get me wrong I still believe in order to succeed in life one should always push boundaries and gain as much knowledge as you can but that should not be in times of rush, it will hinder the process and making you feel discouraged. Likely, I was not going to deep and stuck to web-development. I took me around half a hear to get through the basics and get my first full-stack developer position and good company [**PS.KZ**](https://ps.kz)

That's all for the time being. I might elaborate more but I believe that was all I wanted to share on the topic.
Stay hungry for the knowledge and finish task in front of you!
